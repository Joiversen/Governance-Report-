# Getting Started

*Welcome to our OS2 project! We appreciate your interest in
contributing. This guide outlines how you can get involved and make a
positive impact.*

:unlock: **Get access!**

> Make sure all participants have github accounts and have at least run through a basic tutorial on git and github.
> 
> [Start your journey - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey)

:loudspeaker: **Request a sandbox**

> Send os an [email](os2@os2.eu) and request a [OS2 Sandbox - GitHub](https://github.com/OS2sandbox/) repository and an onboarding session with OS2 where we set up repositories, automations, builds, github issues as issue-tracker and etc. together based on our existing templates currently located in [OS2 – Offentligt Digitaliseringsfællesskab · GitHub](https://github.com/OS2offdig)
> 
> email: [os2@os2.eu](mailto:os2@os2.eu)

:pencil: **Describe the user stories**

> To enable relations between the business value created by user stories and your technical tasks, use GitHub issues to create and track them alongside each other. Add labels to the issues and assign the stories and tasks to Milestones. An example of this can be requested in an onboarding session with os2.

:recycle: **Design the solution with reusable components**

> To establish a foundation for a [cost efficient, interoperable and transparent project](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:ri:diva-72465), reuse existing, well-maintained open source components in your architecture. Even if a component isn’t a perfect fit, contributing to an existing project can save a lot of maintenance time and resources, compared to creating a duplicate of a common component from scratch.

> Reach out and discuss your suggestions with OS2 and create an [Architectural Decision Record](https://adr.github.io/) documenting your design choices.

:twisted_rightwards_arrows: **Streamline contributions through collaborative reviews**

> Following the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), contribute code and docs to the documented issues by creating a branch for each issue to isolate your work and enable collaborating on reviews. Create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) when your work is tested and ready for review. After acceptance testing, the Product Owner can merge the finished feature that solves the user story into the main branch. Get in touch with OS2 if you need to be onboarded to this development flow standard.

:books: **Initiate automated documentation practices from the outset**

> Start by cloning the [Os2 documentation template.]([GitHub - OS2offdig/os2-docs-template: Standard template for documentation in OS2 products](https://github.com/OS2offdig/os2-docs-template)) This automatse the set up a simple searchable documentation site, ready to recive your docs. Start by including a README and document how to get started with developing and how to get at quick local version up and running.
