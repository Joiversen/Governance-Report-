## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ensuring Consistent & Relevant Documentation
_By working with and storing the documentation in the same place as the source code, it becomes easier to maintain and ensure that the documentation is always up to date._
###### Standards & technologies used: [Markdown]() | [Github & Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git) | [Docs as Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/)

#### üéÅ Low Barrier for contributions
Contributions to the documentation take place in simple text documents with simple syntax and free choice between a multitude of open tools available on all platforms. It ensures more accurate documentation and facilitates collaboration between developers and technical writers.

#### ‚úÖ Consistency and standardization
The documentation can be kept in a uniform style and formatting across all documents. This makes it easier for users to navigate and understand the content.
It reduces confusion and ensures that all documents follow the same standard

#### üîÄ Transparency and cooperation
Documents are versioned alongside the source code, with the same toolbox. This allows you to see how the documentation has evolved and track changes. It improves transparency and collaboration, and reduces context switching making it easy to contribute to the documentation without interruption.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Open access to streaminlined searchable documentation
_Using modern documentation technology and automation, open, searchable documentation is delivered with a minimum of work_

###### Technologies used: [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) | [GitHub Pages]() | [Jekyll]() | [JustTheDocs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/)

#### üåê Open access
By making the documentation publicly available via a web page that is indexed by external search engines (like Google), the administration and communication tasks associated with providing access to the documentation are removed. All stakeholders can easily find and use it via their preferred search methods and search engines. This saves time and makes it easier for everyone to access the documentation.

#### :medal_military: Quality and reliability
Automatic updating of the documentation every time new versions of the software are released ensures that the documentation is always up to date. This reduces the risk of outdated or inaccurate information.

#### üîé Built-in quick search
Via automatic indexing and a simple, globally accessible search field, topics and sections relating to the entered keywords are suggested.
This supports quick and easy access to exactly the documentation users demand without the need for manual maintenance of tables of contents and subject summaries.

## Maximizing Software Quality & Efficiency with Reusability

###### Principles used:  [Upstream first](https://ospo-alliance.org/ggi/activities/upstream_first/)


- Shared Maintenance: When changes are contributed upstream, the maintenance burden for those changes is shared with the community, reducing the load on your own team.

- Improved Security:
 Open source software (OSS) is developed by a large community. It‚Äôs rigorously tested and vulnerabilities are patched quickly. 

- Improvec Quality:
OSS taps into a global pool of talent, leading to better code and quick bug fixes.

- Safely Leverage Advanced Tech:
    OSS allows businesses to leverage advanced tech and have access to the latest innovations.





#### Lower TCO / Cost efficiency
0 licensing fees
As a result of these factors, the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of open source solutions is often significantly lower than that of proprietary software.



#### Quality:
OSS taps into a global pool of talent, leading to better code and quick bug fixes.

#### Customizability:
OSS delivers a level of flexibility that proprietary software often cannot match.
When external changes happend, they are not always communicated all the way down to the application development teams. This leaves short time to adapt the software to the new external conditions, impeeding a greater risk of non-compliant, non-functioning, unstable or maybe even insecure software.

#### Freedom:
OSS provides the freedom to use, modify, and redistribute the software. Businesses aren‚Äôt locked into a single vendor and can collaborate to improve the software.

#### Transparency:
Open Source Software (OSS) is founded on transparency and collaboration, fostering trust in digital infrastructure. This transparency enables everyone to scrutinize the way the software‚Äôs operates, unlike proprietary software where the source code is unavailable. That gives you the freedon to delegate the review and assesesment of the product‚Äôs security, efficiency, and quality to independent experts, mitigating the risk of blind trust.

#### Interoperability:
OSS is usually compatible with other software applications, making it easier to integrate into various systems and saving time and money.

#### Upstream First Policy:
An upstream-first policy ensures that any changes your business makes to the open source software are contributed back to the original project. This has several benefits:
- Future Compatibility: By contributing changes upstream, you ensure that your modifications will be compatible with future versions of the software.

- Influence: Contributing to the upstream project can give your business a say in the project‚Äôs direction, allowing you to help shape the software in a way that benefits your business.


Safely Leverage Advanced Tech: OSS allows businesses to leverage advanced tech and have access to the latest innovations.
