## Low Barriers for Transparency and Consistency in the Documentation Process
_By integrating our documentation process directly with the source code, we create a seamless environment for maintaining and updating our documentation, paving a clear path for keeping it up to date._

###### Standards & technologies used: [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/#what-is-github-flavored-markdown-) | [Github & Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git) | [Docs as Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/)

#### üéÅ Low Barrier for contributions
Contributions to the documentation take place in simple text documents with simple syntax and free choice between a multitude of open tools available on all platforms. It ensures more accurate documentation and facilitates collaboration between developers and technical writers.

#### ‚úÖ Consistency and standardization
The documentation can be kept in a uniform style and formatting across all documents. This makes it easier for users to navigate and understand the content.

#### üîÄ Transparency and collaboration
Documents are managed together with the source code in an open version control system. Everyone can follow how the documentation has developed over time and it is easy to track changes and understand why they were made. Developers, technical editors and other stakeholders can collaborate on the documentation with shared methods and tools. This reduces context switching between systems and promotes a common understanding of the task at hand.

## Streamlined up-to-date documentation with open access and built in search 
_Using modern documentation technology and automation metods like Continous Integration, An open and searchable documentation portal is delivered automatically when the documentation is updated_

###### Technologies and methods used: [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) | [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) | [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) | [JustTheDocs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) | [Continous Integration](https://www.ibm.com/topics/continuous-integration) 

#### üåê Open access
By making the documentation publicly available via a web page that is indexed by external search engines (like Google), the administration and communication tasks associated with providing access to the documentation are removed. All stakeholders can easily find and use it via their preferred search methods and search engines. This saves time and makes it easier for everyone to access the documentation.

#### üîé Built-in quick search
Via automatic indexing and a simple, globally accessible search field, topics and sections relating to the entered keywords are suggested.
This supports quick and easy access to exactly the documentation users demand without the need for manual maintenance of tables of contents and subject summaries.

#### :medal_military: Quality and reliability
Automatic updating of the documentation every time new versions of the software are released ensures that the documentation is always up to date. This reduces the risk of outdated or inaccurate information.


## Maximizing Software Quality & Efficiency with Reusability

###### Principles used:  [Upstream first](https://ospo-alliance.org/ggi/activities/upstream_first/)


#### üì§ Shared Maintenance:
When changes are contributed upstream, the maintenance burden for those changes is shared with the community, reducing the load on your own team.


#### üõ°Ô∏è Improved Security:
 Open source software (OSS) is developed by a large community. It‚Äôs rigorously tested and vulnerabilities are patched quickly. 


#### üåü Quality:
OSS taps into a global pool of talent, leading to better code and quick bug fixes.

#### Safely Leverage Advanced Tech:
OSS allows businesses to leverage advanced tech and have access to the latest innovations.

#### Lower TCO / Cost efficiency
0 licensing fees
As a result of these factors, the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of open source solutions is often significantly lower than that of proprietary software.


#### Customizability:
OSS delivers a level of flexibility that proprietary software often cannot match.
When external changes happend, they are not always communicated all the way down to the application development teams. This leaves short time to adapt the software to the new external conditions, impeeding a greater risk of non-compliant, non-functioning, unstable or maybe even insecure software.

#### Freedom:
OSS provides the freedom to use, modify, and redistribute the software. Businesses aren‚Äôt locked into a single vendor and can collaborate to improve the software.

#### Transparency:
Open Source Software (OSS) is founded on transparency and collaboration, fostering trust in digital infrastructure. This transparency enables everyone to scrutinize the way the software‚Äôs operates, unlike proprietary software where the source code is unavailable. That gives you the freedon to delegate the review and assesesment of the product‚Äôs security, efficiency, and quality to independent experts, mitigating the risk of blind trust.

#### Interoperability:
OSS is usually compatible with other software applications, making it easier to integrate into various systems and saving time and money.

#### Upstream First Policy:
An upstream-first policy ensures that any changes your business makes to the open source software are contributed back to the original project. This has several benefits:
- Future Compatibility: By contributing changes upstream, you ensure that your modifications will be compatible with future versions of the software.

- Influence: Contributing to the upstream project can give your business a say in the project‚Äôs direction, allowing you to help shape the software in a way that benefits your business.


Safely Leverage Advanced Tech: OSS allows businesses to leverage advanced tech and have access to the latest innovations.
