## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Simple and independently formatted documentation
_By working with and storing the documentation in the same place as the source code, it becomes easier to maintain and ensure that the documentation is always up to date._
###### Standards & technologies used: [Markdown]() | [Github & Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git) | [Docs as Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/)

#### üéÅ Low Barrier for contributions
Contributions to the documentation take place in simple text documents with simple syntax and free choice between a multitude of open tools available on all platforms. It ensures more accurate documentation and facilitates collaboration between developers and technical writers.

#### ‚úÖ Consistency and standardization
The documentation can be kept in a uniform style and formatting across all documents. This makes it easier for users to navigate and understand the content.
It reduces confusion and ensures that all documents follow the same standard

#### üîÄ Security and cooperation
Documents are versioned alongside the source code, with the same toolbox. This allows you to see how the documentation has evolved and track changes. It improves transparency and collaboration, and reduces context switching making it easy to contribute to the documentation without interruption.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Automated documentation portal
_Using modern documentation technology and automation, a uniform appearance, open, searchable documentation portal can be delivered with a minimum of work_

###### Technologies used: [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) | [GitHub Pages]() | [Jekyll]() | [JustTheDocs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/)

#### üåê Open access
By making the documentation publicly available via a web page that is indexed by external search engines (like Google), the administration and communication tasks associated with providing access to the documentation are removed. All stakeholders can easily find and use it via their preferred search methods and search engines. This saves time and makes it easier for everyone to access the documentation.

#### :medal_military: Quality and reliability
Automatic updating of the documentation every time new versions of the software are released ensures that the documentation is always up to date. This reduces the risk of outdated or inaccurate information.

#### üîé Built-in quick search
Via automatic indexing and a simple, globally accessible search field, topics and sections relating to the entered keywords are suggested.
This supports quick and easy access to exactly the documentation users demand without the need for manual maintenance of tables of contents and subject summaries.

## Cheaper better software to build and to run by reuse


0 licensing fees, easier and thus cheeper to adapt, longterm
As a result of these factors, the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of open source solutions is often significantly lower than that of proprietary software.

#### Security:
 Open source software (OSS) is developed by a large community, making it more secure. It‚Äôs rigorously tested and vulnerabilities are patched quickly.

#### Flexibility and Agility:
 OSS allows businesses to quickly adapt to changes, customize software to their needs, and scale their infrastructure.

Freedom: OSS provides the freedom to use, modify, and redistribute the software. Businesses aren‚Äôt locked into a single vendor and can collaborate to improve the software.

Cost: OSS is often free or cheaper than proprietary solutions, with no ongoing licensing fees. The Total 
Cost of Ownership (TCO) is typically lower.

Higher Quality Software: OSS taps into a global pool of talent, leading to better code and quick bug fixes.

Safely Leverage Advanced Tech: OSS allows businesses to leverage advanced tech and have access to the latest innovations.

Works in the Cloud: OSS is designed to work in the cloud, making it ideal for hybrid cloud architectures.

Time to Market: OSS often has a shorter time to market as it‚Äôs simpler and easier to implement.

Transparency: OSS is built on transparency and collaboration, instilling trust in digital infrastructure.

Interoperability: OSS is usually compatible with other software applications, making it easier to integrate into various systems and saving time and money.
